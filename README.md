# System-Analysis-and-Design
Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?


The client is DriverPass. The purpose is to fill the need for better driver training and to help customers that would often fail the driving test at the DMV. Thesystem was to be developed with a cloud based design.


What did you do particularly well?


I made sure that the project would have great security for all of the users by implementing SSL, Two Factor authorization and login security.


If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?


I would change the UML sequence diagram, I feel that I could have added more information to it.


How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?


I made sure to only incorparate the things that they requested and not my own preferences on the project. At the end of the day, they must be happy with their product.


How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?


I listen objectively and try to incorporate the clients requirements into the design. I will continue to follow any privacy or ethics guidelines.
